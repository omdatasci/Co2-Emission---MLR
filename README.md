# Co2_Emission-MLR
Predicting carbon emission using Multilinear Regression technique.

This model helps to find out the Co2 emission of vehicle depending upon vehicle type, engine size, fuel type, cylinders etc. 

Project Steps-
1.Download a CSV data file of fuel consumption from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets.This dataset contains various features which have direct effect on Co2 emission.

2.Identified the most relevant features with different techniques(Correlation, Varience) to improve the predictive power of the model.

3.Developed and trained predictive models using Multilinear Regression technique.

4.Built a web app of that model using flask framework and deploy the model into production environment with the help of ngrok host platform.
